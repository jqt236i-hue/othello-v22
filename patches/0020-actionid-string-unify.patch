Subject: 0020 - Unify actionId as string (ActionSchema)

Summary:
- Remove numeric actionId assumptions from ActionSchema by requiring string actionId and forbidding numeric auto-generation.
- Keep deprecated numeric generator stubs that throw, to prevent accidental use and confirm no call sites remain.

Evidence (numeric assumptions in ActionSchema):
- actionIdCounter / numeric generator: [game/schema/action.js](game/schema/action.js#L20-L33)
- createAction generated numeric actionId: [game/schema/action.js](game/schema/action.js#L45-L63)
- validateAction required number: [game/schema/action.js](game/schema/action.js#L76-L90)
- normalizeAction auto-generated numeric actionId: [game/schema/action.js](game/schema/action.js#L142-L156)

Changes:
- createAction now requires a non-empty string actionId in payload; no numeric auto-generation.
- validateAction enforces non-empty string actionId.
- normalizeAction requires string actionId and throws if missing (no silent numeric fallback).
- generateActionId / actionIdCounter marked @deprecated and generateActionId throws if called.

Files changed:
- M game/schema/action.js

How to verify:
- npm run test:jest -i
- npm run check:ui-writers
