PR: Fix CPU duplicate runs and reduce Auto fallback races

Summary:
- Prevents duplicate CPU turns where both sides could auto-play after a human move.
- Implements small, conservative changes to dedupe near-simultaneous CPU triggers and to reduce race windows in UI toggles.

Changes:
- ui/bootstrap.js
  - Set default `window.CPU_DEDUPE_MS = 150` when not provided (tests/runtime override OK).
- cpu/cpu-turn.js
  - Early return after delegating to handler.runCpuTurn to avoid duplicate local processing.
  - Update `__cpuLastRunAt` timestamp when CPU starts to allow external dedupe checks.
- ui/presentation-handler.js
  - Added `getCpuDedupeMs()` and skip fallback CPU scheduling if a recent CPU run occurred.
- ui/handlers/auto.js, ui/ui-adapters.js
  - Replace `setTimeout(..., 0)` with microtask-based scheduling (`queueMicrotask` / `Promise.resolve().then`) to tighten ordering and reduce race windows.
- Tests added:
  - tests/unit/cpu/processCpuTurn.noDoubleRun.test.js
  - tests/unit/cpu/cpu-turn.fallback-dedupe.test.js
  - tests/unit/ui/presentation-handler.dedupe-config.test.js

Validation:
- Unit tests added and run locally (all passed).
- Smoke tests run locally ("All smoke tests passed.").
- Playwright scripts adjusted for determinism and used to validate race scenarios.

Notes and next steps:
- This is intentionally a minimal, low-risk change set. A medium-term improvement would be a centralized CPU scheduler (`game/cpu-scheduler.js`) to fully unify triggers and scheduling. This can be done separately.
